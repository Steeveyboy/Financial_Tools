The U.S.-based electric car maker has recalled 67,698 Model S and Model X cars imported to China between Sept. 25, 2013 and Nov. 21, 2020, due to software problems affecting the battery management system in the vehicles.
Tesla said it will upgrade the software of recalled vehicles.
Tesla also recalled 2,736 imported Model 3 cars manufactured between January and November 2019, and 10,127 China-made ones of the same model produced between Oct. 14, 2019 and Sept. 26, 2022. This was due to potentially faulty seat belt installation which Tesla will check and reinstall, it said.
In April, Tesla recalled a total of 127,785 units of Model 3 cars in China, citing potential faults in semiconductor components that might lead to collisions. read more

""Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta is now available to anyone in North America who requests it from the car screen, assuming you have bought this option,"" Musk tweeted.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Musk said last month that Tesla's advanced driver assistant software would not gain regulatory approval in 2022.
Musk hopes to provide an update to Full Self Driving (FSD) in 2023 to show regulators that the technology is much safer than the average human driver.
The Silicon Valley automaker sells a $15,000 FSD software add-on which enables its vehicles to change lanes and park autonomously. That complements its standard ""Autopilot"" feature, which enables cars to steer, accelerate and brake within their lanes without driver intervention.
Tesla, which has been criticized for testing its unfinished tech on public roads, is also under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice over claims that the company's electric vehicles can drive themselves, Reuters reported in October.

MOSCOW, Nov 23 (Reuters) - After a two-decade hiatus, Russia on Wednesday launched production of the Moskvich car brand at a plant near Moscow given up by the French carmaker Renault, with a new, modern Chinese design that barely resembles the Soviet-era classic.
While the last Moskvich (""Muscovite"") was a basic three-box saloon or pedestrian hatchback, the Moskvich 3 is a muscular-looking petrol-powered crossover hatchback with alloy wheels, LED slit-headlights and a large central touchscreen display.
In fact, the car looks identical to the Sehol X4 compact crossover made by China's JAC, also known as the JAC JS4.
Sources told Reuters that JAC's design, engineering and platform were being used, with parts being delivered from China, and the vehicles shown at the launch displayed numerous JAC stickers bearing part codes.
However, Maxim Klyushkin, the plant’s project manager, declined to confirm that the Chinese firm was Moskvich's partner.
""We have (Russian truck maker) Kamaz as an external partner and we have a long-distance partner we are working with,"" he said. ""We are not naming that partner.""
Klyushkin said the car would have an anti-lock braking system (ABS), one of the features that Russia's Avtovaz has been forced to remove from Lada models because of the Western trade sanctions imposed in response to Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine.
Renault (RENA.PA) sold its majority stake in Avtovaz in May to the Russian state for reportedly just one rouble, but with a six-year option to buy it back. It sold its plant, now renamed the Moscow Automobile Factory Moskvich, for another rouble.

FALLING CAR SALES
With just 600 vehicles slated for production this year, the new car is unlikely to alter the gloomy outlook for the wider industry, whose annual sales could end the year below 1 million for the first time in Russia's modern history.
The government's ultimate target of producing 100,000 Moskvich vehicles a year, some of which will be electric, is far below the industry average for a car plant of 200,000-300,000. Tesla makes 22,000 cars a week at its Shanghai plant.
""The first Moskvich cars will come off the production line in December 2022,"" Kamaz (KMAZ.MM) said in a statement.
Western sanctions over Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine have not only hampered access to foreign-made components but also helped to drive out foreign manufacturers.
Kamaz and the government have established new supply chains, but not disclosed details.
""The task for the near future is to establish small-node assembly processes with the involvement of local suppliers by the end of 2023,"" Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said in a statement.
The ministry said the launch of full-scale production would provide jobs for around 40,000 more people. The car goes on sale in Russia next month, it added, although the price has yet to be disclosed. President Vladimir Putin last week urged carmakers to keep prices down.

Nov 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes ended Wednesday with solid gains after the Federal Reserve's November meeting minutes showed interest rate hikes may slow soon.
A ""substantial majority"" of policymakers agreed it would ""likely soon be appropriate"" to slow the pace of interest rate hikes, the minutes showed.
""What equity markets needed to see for the recent strength to continue was what we got from the minutes,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
Since the Fed's last meeting on Nov. 1-2, investors have been more optimistic that price pressures have started to ease, meaning smaller rate hikes could curtail inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 95.96 points, or 0.28%, to 34,194.06, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 23.68 points, or 0.59%, at 4,027.26 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 110.91 points, or 0.99%, at 11,285.32.
Trading volume was thin ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, with the U.S. stock market open for a half-session on Friday.
Earlier on Wednesday, a mixed bag of economic data led to a drop in yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note , helping drive stocks up.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week and U.S. business activity contracted for a fifth straight month in November. Consumer sentiment ticked higher and home sales rose above expectations. read more

Musk had made the remark in a video call with President Yoon Suk-yeol, adding that the company planned to step up cooperation with South Korea on supply chains, Yoon's office said.
As Yoon was aware of Tesla's plans to build a factory in Asia in the future, his office said, Yoon asked Musk to build the factory in South Korea.
In response, Musk said he considered South Korea to be one of the top candidates and would make the decision after reviewing investment conditions in other countries, including labour quality, technology level and production infrastructure.
Tesla was not immediately available for comment outside U.S. business hours when contacted by Reuters.
""We expect to buy components worth more than $10 billion from South Korean firms in 2023 as we significantly expand supply chain cooperation with South Korean companies,"" Yoon's office quoted Musk as saying.
The contact between Yoon and Musk comes ahead of a criminal trial about to begin in South Korea that hangs on questions about the safety of Tesla cars, at a time when the EV maker faces a range of lawsuits and increased scrutiny by regulators.
Yoon said in the discussion he would reform unreasonable regulations that hindered investment by global tech companies, according to Yoon's office. The president added that the government would continue its effort to attract investment from high-tech companies to enhance the country's competitiveness.
Indonesia, India and other government are already lobbying to win Tesla's next investment in EV production.
In August, Indonesian President Joko Widodo urged Tesla to make EVs in the country. The president and senior government officials held meetings earlier this year with Musk, during which they said they had asked him to consider the Southeast Asian country as a car manufacturing hub, on top of making batteries.
South Korea's LG Energy Solution Ltd (373220.KS) supplies Tesla with batteries, as do Japan's Panasonic Corp Holding (6752.T) and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (300750.SZ).
Analysts said Tesla could work closely with such South Korean suppliers as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and LG Innotek Co Ltd (011070.KS) if it built the factory in the country.

It's one of the first major EV-related investments announced by a South Korean firm in the United States since a new U.S. law was passed in August that puts automakers and battery suppliers relying heavily on China for sourcing at a cost disadvantage.
Mass production is set to start in the second half of 2025 and the plant will create more than 850 jobs, LG Chem said in a statement.
The plant is slated to have an annual production capacity of 120,000 tonnes of cathode materials by 2027, enough to power about 1.2 million electric vehicles, it added.
Its shares climbed 1.9% on the news, outperforming a 0.3% decline for the broader market (.KS11).
LG Chem added that it is also pursuing cooperation with mining firms and recycling companies to better support its customers so that requirements of the new law, the Inflation Reduction Act, can be met.
LG Chem is expected to supply cathode materials to Ultium Cells, a battery joint venture between General Motors (GM.N) and LG Chem's subsidiary LG Energy Solution Ltd (LGES) (373220.KS).
LGES, which supplies batteries to Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) among others, last month raised its 2022 revenue outlook to 25 trillion won ($18.4 billion) from 22 trillion, citing new projects from automakers.
LG Chem's new plant will make cathodes for batteries with a nickel, cobalt, manganese and aluminum (NCMA) chemistry. The NCMA battery, which is about 90% nickel, allows manufacturers to reduce their reliance on expensive cobalt, and reduce their exposure to refining and processing in China.
China currently has 75% of the world's cobalt refining capacity and 50% of the lithium processing capacity, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
GM has said it will use NCMA battery cathodes from LG Chem for a range of EVs using Ultium-branded batteries.
The Inflation Reduction Act will, among other measures, require from next year that at least 40% of the monetary value of critical minerals for batteries be from the United States or an American free-trade partner in order to qualify for U.S. tax credits. That share will rise to 80% in 2027.
Automakers such as Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and Kia Corp (000270.KS) have been hit hard by the new law, which immediately ended credits for about 70% of the 72 car models that were previously eligible for EV subsidies.
At this month's G20 summit, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol asked U.S. President Joe Biden to prevent discriminatory measures against South Korean companies, his office said.
It added Biden had replied that the implementation of the law should account for the contribution of South Korean investment in the U.S. economy.

GameStop, which is among the so-called ""meme stocks"", was popular among retail investors during the pandemic in what came to be known as the ""short squeeze"".
Short-sellers borrow shares and sell them, seeking to profit by returning them after buying the stock back at a lower price.
Icahn began shorting the stock around January 2021, the report added but did not provide details of the size of Icahn's position.
The stock, which has lost nearly a third of its value so far this year, fell about 9% on Monday.
Short interest in GameStop's stock is very high, with 17.53% of the company's outstanding shares shorted as of Oct. 31, according to Refinitiv data. In comparison, short interests in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the world's largest public company, and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), the world's most valuable auto maker, are 0.65% and is 2.43%, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.
In September, GameStop announced a partnership with Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX US to increase its presence in the cryptocurrency space even as analysts said the partnership was ""unlikely to yield meaningful revenue or profit"".
Earlier this month, FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in the biggest crypto industry blow up till date.
The retailer executed a four-for-one stock split this year, the stock rose a split-adjusted high of over $120 in Jan. 2021.

The news follows the company's recall on Friday of nearly 30,000 Model X cars in the United States over an issue that may cause the front passenger air bag to deploy incorrectly, which sent its shares down almost 3% to a near two-year low.
In the filing published Saturday to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the electric vehicle manufacturer said the tail light-related recall covers some 2023 Model 3 and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles.
Texas-based Tesla said it will deploy an over-the-air update to correct the rear light issue and said it has no reports of any crashes or injuries related to the recall.
The company said the recall followed customer complaints it became aware of in late October, largely from foreign markets, claiming vehicle tail lights were not illuminating.
The investigation found in rare cases the lights may intermittently not work due to an anomaly that may cause false fault detections during the vehicle wake-up process. Tesla said it had received three warranty reports over the issue.
Tesla has reported 19 U.S. recall campaigns in 2022 covering more than 3.7 million vehicles including four callbacks in November, according to NHTSA data.

The fiery crash killed a prominent lawyer - a close friend of South Korea's president.
Prosecutors have charged the driver with involuntary manslaughter. He blames Tesla.
Choi Woan-jong, who had eked out a living by driving drunk people home in their own cars, says the Model X sped out of control on its own and that the brakes failed in the December 2020 accident.
The criminal trial about to begin in South Korea hangs on questions about the safety of Tesla cars, at a time when the EV maker faces a range of lawsuits and increased scrutiny by regulators.
Choi, 61, is now unable to find work as an independent driver, or what is known in Korea as a ""replacement driver"".
He says he suffers flashbacks and depression ahead of a trial that pits his credibility against the world's most valuable automaker.
""When I wake up, I feel abandoned, floating alone in the middle of the ocean,"" said Choi, who underwent surgery after the crash for a ruptured intestine.
Tesla did not respond to written requests for comment about the crash and Choi's case. A lawyer for the family of Yoon Hong-geun, who owned the car and died in the crash, declined to comment.
Choi's case has drawn the attention of some safety advocates in South Korea who want to change a provision in the free trade agreement with the United States that exempts Tesla from local standards.
For instance, Tesla is not required to follow South Korean regulations that require at least one front-seat and back-seat door to have a mechanical failsafe because the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement exempts carmakers with sales under 50,000 vehicles from local safety rules.
Tesla sold 17,828 vehicles in South Korea in 2021, registration data shows.
Park Keun-oh, an official from the Korea-U.S. FTA division of South Korea's trade ministry, said the exemption clause requires Tesla to abide by American safety regulations, which do not require mechanical backup latch. Such latches allow doors to be opened even if the car does not have electrical power.
Park declined to comment further. The Office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to requests for comment about the trade deal or the regulations.
Prosecutors say Choi floored the accelerator as he entered the garage of a Seoul apartment building, hitting 95 kph (60mph) before crashing. He denies that, saying the car's side mirrors began folding in and out uncommanded just before the car accelerated on its own.
""It felt like the car was swept away by a hurricane,"" said Choi, who said he had been driving for more than 20 years and had experience driving Teslas.
The automaker provided prosecutors with data from the Model X that the car transmitted in the moments before the crash, the judge said at a preliminary hearing. The defence team has asked to see the data and is waiting for the court to release it.
Choi and his lawyer are seeking to show that the car's electrical systems failed and that its design slowed firefighters' attempts to rescue Yoon.
The Tesla's battery caught fire after the crash. Smoke and flames filled the car, according to firefighters and a video of the scene, taken by firefighters and viewed by Reuters.
Choi escaped through a broken window on his side. Firefighters were delayed in pulling Yoon out of the back seat, because the Model X's electronic doors failed to open from outside, a Dec. 31, 2020, fire department report reviewed by Reuters shows. The report does not say how long the rescue was delayed.
Yoon, 60, was pronounced dead after firefighters extricated him from the car and performed CPR. The cause of death was not made public.
Judge Park Won-gyu said that he plans to call Tesla engineers to testify and that the safety of Tesla vehicles would be examined at trial. Involuntary manslaughter carries a potential prison sentence of up to five years.

A FIERY SCENE
The investigation by the fire station that responded found the battery failure slowed the emergency response by disabling seat controls, which prevented firefighters from repositioning the front seats so they could get to Yoon, according to the fire department report.
The electrical outage made it ""impossible to secure space for the (rescue) operation"", the report said.
A fire station representative declined to comment.
The report says exterior door handles on the Model X, which are electronic, did not open from the outside as the battery burned. It also says firefighters could not pull Yoon from the car because they couldn't move the front seats after the battery died.
A video of the rescue shows firefighters trying but failing to open the Model X's wing-style doors. They eventually broke through the front windshield and pulled Yoon from the car about 25 minutes after the emergency call came in, according to the footage and the firefighters' report.
Tesla is the only automaker that does not provide data to the Korea Transportation Safety Authority (TS) from onboard diagnostic systems for safety checks in South Korea, according to the agency and Park Sang-hyuk, a lawmaker with the opposition Democratic Party of Korea who, spurred by Choi's crash, has campaigned for regulators to pressure Tesla to change its door handles and work with regulators.
TS noted that Tesla is not legally required to provide such data, but that all other foreign and domestic carmakers are doing so.
Park and TS said Tesla is working with the agency to allow Korean owners to access their car's diagnostic data starting in October 2023.
""Tesla has become something of an icon for great innovation, but I think (the company's issues in Korea) also raise a serious concern for customers here,"" Park said, referring to cases in which Tesla's doors will not open after a collision, and the free trade agreement provisions.
A South Korean consumer group, Citizens United for Consumer Sovereignty, said in September that Tesla had not fixed what the group calls ""door defects"". The group says it has collected information on about 1,870 complaints involving Tesla doors over the past four years. Data provided to Reuters by another South Korean lawmaker, and TS, confirmed that number.
The consumer group said that it asked police to investigate Tesla over not improving driver and passenger safety after the fatal crash in Seoul, but that police told them in May there was not enough evidence to proceed, according to their report, seen by Reuters.
In a June 29 letter to the consumer group, seen by Reuters, police say that although Tesla's door latches might violate local safety standards, that consideration was trumped by the terms of the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement.
Tesla doors ""could be in violation of the (local) regulations, but it (Tesla) has no obligations to comply with local motor vehicle safety standards in accordance with the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement,"" the police letter said.
In South Korean courts, drivers in cases where a crash's cause is disputed face the burden of proving the car had a defect, three legal and auto safety experts say, and vehicle manufacturers are almost never prosecuted over safety issues.
""Unless you have gone through this, you will never know how it feels,” said Ahn Ho-joon, another ""replacement driver"" in South Korea, who had a Tesla accident in May nearly identical to Choi's, police records show.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
Ahn, one of the few to attend all of Choi's pre-trial hearings, says the Tesla he drove also accelerated on its own and crashed into two vehicles in an underground garage, but there were no serious injuries. Police say the accident was his fault because there were no issues with the vehicle, but did not charge him because the wreck was minor.
Ahn said he has kept his job as an independent replacement driver, but declines to drive Teslas.
Choi, unable to work and nearly out of money, has moved into a 6.6-square-metre (71-square-foot) cubicle he rents for 350,000 won ($243) a month. Financed by state housing subsidies, it includes a shared bathroom and kitchen, and all the rice he can eat. Despite these hardships, Choi takes the long view on Tesla.
""Obviously there's a process to make products perfect through trial and error. And I am just destined to be part of that process,"" he said.

Consumer discretionary stocks, a group whose members run the gamut from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and automaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) to retailer Target Corp (TGT.N), have been walloped by surging prices, with the S&P 500’s consumer discretionary sector falling nearly 33% for the year to date compared with a nearly 17% fall for the broader index.
Yet recent data has shown signs that inflation may be ebbing in the face of stronger-than-expected retail spending, raising cautious optimism that the economy could avoid a recession or experience only a mild downturn. Investors poured a net $1.05 billion into consumer discretionary stocks in the past week, the sixth-largest weekly inflows since 2008, data from BofA Global Research showed.
The upcoming Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and traditionally one of the year’s biggest shopping days, may give investors greater insight into the extent that consumers are opening their wallets.
“There’s some questions as to how strong the consumer really is, so this will be a tricky holiday season,” said Edward Yruma, an analyst at Piper Sandler. “Everybody is watching the strength of the consumer and so far the consumer has held.”
Yruma is bullish on retailers Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Target. He believes, however, it may be too early to bet on the sector as a whole since inflation remains high by historical standards while many on Wall Street fear the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening may bring on a U.S. recession.
To be sure, consumer stocks have had more than their fair share of woes this year.
Target shares plunged on Tuesday after the company warned of ""dramatic changes"" in consumer behavior that were hurting demand. Amazon.com, the world's biggest online retailer, said on Oct. 27 it was preparing for slower growth because ""people's budgets are tight"" due to inflation.
The companies' shares are down 29.6% and 43.5% year-to-date, respectively.
While retail sales in October were strong, data suggests that subprime auto loan delinquencies are increasing and higher-income shoppers are starting to trade down, Morgan Stanley economists said in a note on Friday.
""The consumer has been a pillar of strength this year, but as rates keep rising and the labor market slows, consumers will have no choice but to pull back on spending,"" the firm's economists wrote. The bank's analysts are underweight the consumer discretionary sector.
Others, however, see reasons to remain bullish - even in the face of a potential economic downturn.
""Recession fears are so priced in to this group,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. ""If we have a mild recession ... they will do very well from here on out."" He is betting shares of retailers, hotels and restaurants will outperform the rest of the sector in the coming year.
Some companies’ lower valuations may also give investors wiggle room if the economy slows, said Bobby Griffin, an analyst at Raymond James. His firm has a strong ""buy"" on shares of Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which are trading at a 15% discount to their historic forward price-to-earnings multiple.
""We've had this fear of inflation all year and the consumer has held up pretty well so far,"" he said.
At the same time, signs of consumer strength could also be a red flag to the inflation-fighting Fed, bolstering the case for the central bank to push forward with the monetary policy tightening that has pressured markets and drained risk appetite this year.
Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, believes signs that consumers are not being affected by rising rates could lead to a higher-than-expected peak in the Fed’s rate hiking cycle.
""We’re skeptical the worst is behind us,"" he said.

Musk and the Tesla (TSLA.O) directors named as defendants repeatedly testified that the package achieved what it set out to do -- deliver 10-fold growth in the company's stock price, enriching investors and Musk.
""We thought if we could pull this off, if this plan was executed, Tesla would be one of the most valuable technology companies,"" Antonio Gracias, a Tesla board member from 2007 to 2021, told the Delaware Court of Chancery on Wednesday. ""It was a great deal for the shareholders.""
The trial seeks to resolve claims by shareholder Richard Tornetta that the 2018 pay package was dictated by Musk, the world's richest person, to subservient directors and approved by a vote of shareholders who were misled by Tesla.
The trial wrapped up on Friday, as Musk struggles to oversee a chaotic overhaul of Twitter Inc, which he was forced to buy for $44 billion in a separate legal battle before the same judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.
""My sense is that even though it went all the way to trial, a ruling is going to favor Mr. Musk,"" said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School who has followed the case.
It will be months before McCormick rules and her decision can be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.
During the week-long trial, directors said the pay package was meant to ensure Musk guided the electric vehicle maker through a critical phase when he could have focused on his rocket company SpaceX or tunneling venture The Boring Co.
Musk told the board he wanted a huge package to finance his dream of travel to Mars, or as he testified, to make ""life multi-planetary in order to ensure the long-term survival of consciousness.""
Musk described his efforts to push the company from the brink of failure in 2017 to exponential growth. ""The amount of pain, no words can express,"" Musk testified on Wednesday.
Gracias recalled that Musk celebrated his birthday in a factory conference room with a grocery store cake. ""This was all hands on deck, 24/7, brutal,"" he told the court.
The package allows Musk to buy 1% of Tesla's stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met. Otherwise, Musk gets nothing.
Tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets as its value ballooned briefly to more than $1 trillion from $50 billion.
Tornetta wants the plan rescinded and the stock granted under the plan returned to Tesla.
Much of the trial focused on the information provided to shareholders before they approved the plan. Tornetta's lawyers tried to show Tesla concealed that three targets of the package were likely to be quickly met.
The plaintiff portrayed the directors as personal friends or business partners of Musk, who was the link to their wealth.
The directors tried to show they could hold the line against Musk's demands. But evidence of extracting concessions was limited to the best method for accounting for the stock grants and a requirement that Musk had to hold his stock for five years.
""It wasn't a knock-down, drag-out affair,"" Todd Maron testified about the pay talks in 2017 when he was general counsel.
Talley said Musk is a unique CEO and his pay reflects that.
""He's like a Labrador retriever. He sees a ball and he runs after it. You could almost make an argument they didn't pay him enough because he ran off after Twitter.""

Bankman-Fried has sought to explain the implosion of FTX and disparaged government regulators in posts on Twitter and conversations with reporters. Attorneys said such statements will likely make life more difficult for the defense lawyers seeking to manage fallout from the exchange’s demise and navigate multiple federal investigations.
“There’s this old saying that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client. The reverse is also true. An individual who is the subject of an investigation and tries to defend themselves in the court of public opinion has a fool for a lawyer,” said Justin Danilewitz, a white-collar defense lawyer at law firm Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr.
In a conversation with a Vox reporter published this week, Bankman-Fried blamed FTX's collapse in part on “messy accounting,” expressed regret at his decision to file for bankruptcy and denigrated U.S. regulators in profane terms. He later said he did not intend for the conversation to be made public.
FTX is now facing investigations from the U.S. Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, sources have told Reuters. On Tuesday, a group of crypto investors filed a class action against Bankman-Fried and others who promoted FTX.
Bankman-Fried's statements have already been cited in FTX’s U.S. bankruptcy proceedings. The exchange’s lawyers said in court papers on Thursday that he was undermining their efforts with his ""incessant and disruptive tweeting.”
He has become the latest high-profile figure to continue to speak publicly despite facing serious legal scrutiny, joining a group that has included Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Twitter CEO Elon Musk, ex-pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli and former U.S. President Donald Trump.
CONTROLLING THE STORY
Lawyers almost always advise clients in litigation or facing government investigations not to speak about issues related to the case. Such statements could become evidence in court and could undermine a carefully crafted defense. Social media has made it easier for clients with large public platforms to try to mount their own defense, experts said.
“The basic question is who controls the story,” said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University and an expert on legal ethics. “From the lawyer’s point of view, once he or she is hired, it’s the lawyer who controls the story as far as public consumption goes.”
At least one attorney, Martin Flumenbaum of law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, has already parted ways with Bankman-Fried, though the lawyer did not blame the 30-year-old entrepreneur's controversial statements.
“We informed Mr. Bankman-Fried several days ago after the filing of the FTX bankruptcy that conflicts have arisen that precluded us from representing him,"" Flumenbaum said in a statement to Reuters.
Flumenbaum declined to describe the conflicts. A onetime lawyer for convicted financier Michael Milken, Flumenbaum is currently defending Christian Larsen, the founder and chair of crypto payment and exchange company Ripple Labs Inc, in a high-profile lawsuit filed by the SEC. His law firm represents many other financial industry clients.
Bankman-Fried, who did not respond to questions about his legal team this week, has hired Gregory Joseph, a criminal defense lawyer at law firm Joseph Hage Aaronson in New York, and Stanford University law professor David Mills as members of his legal team, according to a report from Semafor. Both of Bankman-Fried's parents are on the faculty of Stanford Law School.
Joseph is a former president of the American College of Trial Lawyers who has written about racketeering law and rules of evidence. Mills specializes in criminal law and white-collar crime.
Neither Joseph nor Mills replied to requests for comment.

Musk confirmed the move in a tweet, adding that the account of satirical website Babylon Bee was also reinstated.
The new billionaire owner misspelled Griffin and Peterson's names in his tweet.
Musk said in May he would reverse Twitter's ban on Trump, whose account on the social media platform was suspended after last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) chief earlier this month said Twitter users engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying it as a ""parody"" account would be permanently suspended without a warning.
The comment came as Griffin's account was banned earlier this month after the U.S. comedian changed her name to Elon Musk. The #FreeKathy hashtag was later circulating on Twitter.
Twitter had also paused its recently announced $8 blue check subscription service last Friday as fake accounts mushroomed. read more
The fake accounts purporting to be big brands, included those of Musk's Tesla and SpaceX, as well as Roblox, Nestle and Lockheed Martin.

The air bag could deploy incorrectly in certain low-speed collision events where a young front seat passenger is unbelted and out of position, increasing the risk of injury, the company said in a filing with U.S. regulators.
Tesla said it was not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related to the recall.
The problem will be addressed through an over-the-air software update, the company said in a letter filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Earlier this month, the world's most valuable automaker recalled over 40,000 Model S and Model X vehicles due to the risk of experiencing a loss of power steering assist when driving on rough roads or after hitting a pothole.

The European Commission will keep using Twitter as a communication tool, Margrethe Vestager said, while singling out Mastodon - a decentralised, open alternative from Germany - as another popular choice.
The takeover by billionaire Elon Musk earlier this month and the many changes he announced in running Twitter and his warning last week it could go bankrupt have led to speculation about the future of the platform.
""I find it very interesting how these events, so to speak, around Twitter have made many more people curious as to what other services could we potentially use,"" Vestager told reporters in Madrid after meeting Spanish Economy Minister Nadia Calvino.
""A lot of people talk about Mastodon, which is a German-developed service,"" she said. ""I think (it has) a lot of the same features people tend to enjoy on Twitter.""
Calvino said the Spanish government would also keep using Twitter to communicate though if certainty over security is no longer guaranteed it could move to another platform.
Among the changes planned by Musk, who is also Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) top boss, is a subscription service for a 'blue tick' which used to mean Twitter had verified the account belonged to the person or company claiming it. The initial rollout of the paid verification had to be postponed after fake accounts mushroomed.
""For me the blue tick is very essential, because it's part of the trustworthiness of a media, that you know who you are dealing with,"" Vestager said.

Ford Africa head says it needs immediate policy certainty
Says it would take around four years to plan investments
Wants clarity on specific support in auto masterplan
JOHANNESBURG, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The Africa head of Ford Motor Co (F.N) said the South African government must deliver policy certainty on electric vehicles (EVs) within six months to save its automotive industry.
Three quarters of cars produced by South Africa's auto industry, which accounts for 5% of gross domestic product and more than 100,000 jobs, are exported, mostly to Europe.
But with Britain planning to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and the European Union in 2035, the local industry risks losing thousands of jobs and billions in revenue in the absence of a government plan for EVs.
""We need policy certainty, literally, within the next six month period,"" Neale Hill, President of Ford Motor Company in Africa, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
South Africa's trade and industry ministry said it had previously indicated a policy paper would be out by November 2021 but the deadline could not be met due to ""variety of issues"".
""There is a commitment to conclude this matter soon,"" it said.
The government issued an Automotive Masterplan in 2018 to help local makers achieve 1% of global production, increase the use of local materials to 60% from 39% and raise employment, among other objectives. It did not include any policy on EVs.
Hill, who is also the President of South African carmakers' lobby NAAMSA, said auto companies wanted the government to clarify what parts of the master plan are still up for support.
Ford in March boosted its spending on EVs to $50 billion through 2026 as the Dearborn, Michigan-based company tries to catch up with Germany's Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and industry leader Tesla (TSLA.O).
A carmaker takes around four years for an investment decision to convert into an actual funding in a factory, Hill said, adding globally auto companies were making such decisions and South Africa was not featuring in them.
""I'm concerned that (the South African) government's delays and lethargy on this is going to end up costing us having a seat at the table,"" he said.

Companies
BHP's new offer 13% higher than prior bid
OZ Minerals grants four-week due diligence
Deal solidifies BHP's copper-nickel portfolio in Australia
OZ shares up 4%, highest since April 20
Nov 18 (Reuters) - BHP Group Ltd (BHP.AX) has delivered a A$9.6 billion ($6.5 billion) bid for copper and gold producer OZ Minerals (OZL.AX) as the mining major moves to take advantage of rising global demand for metals used in clean energy and electric cars.
In what could be the largest mining deal in Australia in 11 years, BHP made a new cash offer of A$28.25 per share on Friday that was 13% higher than a A$25 per share proposal rejected in early August as ""opportunistic"" and undervalued.
If the deal goes through, it would be the largest mining buyout in Australia since Barrick Gold (ABX.TO) bought Equinox Minerals in 2011 for $5.78 billion, according to Dealogic data.
OZ Minerals shares shot 4.14% higher on Friday to $27.93, its highest point since April. BHP's shares rose 0.6% to $44.06 against a 0.3% gain in Australia's S&P/ASX200 .
The bid was recommended by the OZ Minerals board in the absence of a higher offer.
The new offer is a 49.3% premium to OZ Minerals' A$18.92 trading price in August before BHP's first bid emerged.
BHP's second bid comes amid strong demand for battery metals due to the surging popularity of electric vehicles. Buyout activity has been ramping up in the mining sector, emphasised by Rio Tinto's (RIO.AX)(RIO.L) recent play for Canada's Turquoise Hill (TRQ.TO) to gain control of its Mongolian copper mine.
If OZ Minerals deal goes through, it would allow BHP to consolidate copper assets in South Australia. OZ's mines Prominent Hill and Carrapateena lie next door to BHP's Olympic Dam mine and smelting operations.
The deal would also add to BHP's Western Australia nickel operations, from which it already has a deal to supply Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and and Toyota (7203.T).
OZ said in September it would invest more than $1 billion in its West Musgrave mine in Western Australia. The mine is expected to produce about 35,000 tonnes of nickel and 41,000 tonnes of copper annually in its first five years of production.
""I don't think these are the most amazing assets in the world, but there are synergies for BHP, and it's easier to develop projects in Australia than some other jurisdictions,"" said Andy Forster, senior investment officer at Argo Investments, which has holdings in BHP.
BHP has said its revised offer is its ""best and final"" in the absence of a competing proposal.
OZ Minerals decided to grant BHP exclusive due diligence for a month starting from Nov. 21.
""BHP's revised proposal is a clear reflection of OZ Minerals' unique set of highly strategic, quality assets ... growth pipeline of copper and nickel assets in strong demand due to global electrification,"" said Chief Executive Officer Andrew Cole of OZ Minerals.
