The new material technology known as M3P can enable an electric vehicle to run 700 km (430 miles) per charge combined with CATL's next generation of battery pack technology, Zeng Yuqun said at the World New Energy Vehicle Congress in Beijing on Saturday.
The new materials will also lower the costs compared to nickel and cobalt-based batteries, he added.

Zeng, however, didn't say what metals M3P batteries will use or when mass production could start.
CATL, whose clients include Tesla(TSLA.O), Volkswagen(VOWG_p.DE), BMW(BMWG.DE) and Ford(F.N), is the world's biggest battery maker accounting for more than a third of the sales of batteries for electric vehicles (EV) worldwide.
It aims to increase the lead over rivals such as LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) and BYD by accelerating expansions globally and innovation in new battery technologies.
Wan Gang, Vice Chairman of China's national advisory body for policy making, said the global market size of EV batteries is expected to reach $250 billion by 2030, with demand exceeding 3.5 terrawatt hours. read more
CATL said in a separate announcement on Saturday that it will supply Qilin batteries with its latest battery pack technology to power Geely Automobile Holdings 's Zeekr cars due to hit the market in early 2023.
CALT launched the Qilin battery in June and touted a 13% higher energy density compared to the same size of pack of Tesla's 4680 cylindrical battery cells-- denoting 46 millimetres in diameter and 80 millimetres in length, while using same type of materials.

1,https://www.reuters.com/,Analysis: Musk tests limits of governance by having children with aide,"Elon Musk's decision to have children with one of his top executives at Neuralink pushed the limits of corporate governance norms, according to nine corporate governance experts.",https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-tests-limits-governance-by-having-children-with-aide-2022-08-26/,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/7RyIzCGk68nd4jlQYdqX2-O6VoU=/60x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/WLG75LXJB5LZPM5AGQWSXGLIUM.jpg,2022-08-26,tesla,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's decision to have children with one of his top executives at Neuralink pushed the limits of corporate governance norms, according to nine corporate governance experts who offered divergent interpretations of the startup's code of conduct for employees.
Known more widely for his electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and rocket developer SpaceX, Musk is also the chief executive of Neuralink, a company with about 300 employees that is seeking to develop chips that connect the human brain directly to machines.
He and Shivon Zilis, one of his direct reports at the company, had twin babies last November, Insider reported on July 6, citing a confidential court filing.

Zilis, 36, has since told some of her colleagues that she was not involved romantically with Musk, 51, and conceived the children with him through in vitro fertilization (IVF), according to five people familiar with the situation. Reuters could not establish the accuracy of Zilis’ account.
Zilis and spokespeople for Musk and Neuralink did not respond to requests for comment.
Relationships between supervisors and subordinates are frowned upon at companies and have cost some high-profile CEOs their jobs, as they violate most corporate policies and raise concerns about conflicts of interest, corporate governance experts said.
Neuralink’s 62-page employee handbook, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, prohibits dating, “personal relationships” and “close personal friendships” between employees in a direct supervisory relationship to avoid any conflicts of interest.
But the facts presented by Musk and Zilis’ relationship are so unusual that the corporate governance experts who reviewed the policy for Reuters expressed divergent views on whether they thought the entrepreneur had violated it by having children with his subordinate through IVF.
“Whatever lawyer wrote this language did not contemplate this situation,” said Nell Minow, vice chair of corporate governance consultancy ValueEdge Advisors, referring to the Neuralink code of conduct.
She added that the situation appeared to “fall between the cracks” of the policy’s intent to avoid conflicts of interest due to relationships between employees.
Neuralink’s code of conduct calls for relationships that can create a conflict of interest to be disclosed to the company’s “people operations manager” so that the company can decide whether it should take steps to eliminate any conflict.
Reuters could not learn whether Musk or Zilis had disclosed the relationship to Kristy Hilands, the people operations manager. Hilands did not respond to requests for comment.
Neuralink has accepted Zilis’ description of a non-romantic relationship, and she continues in her role as director of operations and special projects, a source familiar with the company’s handling of the matter said. In the weeks since the disclosure of their having children, Musk and Zilis have also continued working together, taking the helm at internal and external company meetings, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
For example, after learning in recent weeks that competitor Synchron had beaten Neuralink to a human trial in the United States, Musk sent Zilis to approach the company’s CEO Thomas Oxley and arrange a meeting, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Zilis and Musk spoke with Oxley shortly after about a possible investment by Musk in Synchron, the sources said.
OPEN TO INTERPRETATION
Four of the corporate governance experts said they believed Zilis having children with Musk through IVF should be read as having a “personal relationship” or “close friendship” under Neuralink’s code of conduct. The code defines a personal relationship as one where the individuals have a “continuing relationship of a romantic or intimate nature and who are not married to each other.” It does not define a close friendship.
“You’re layering intimate familial bonds over professional relationships,” said Gabriel Rauterberg, a corporate law professor at the University of Michigan. “There is always the worry that someone with greater power will use their professional power in ways that are inappropriate.”
The other five corporate governance experts interviewed by Reuters either did not think Musk and Zilis’ arrangement was a breach under the Neuralink policy or could not come to a definitive conclusion.
Usha Rodrigues, a professor at the University of Georgia’s law school, said Musk and Zilis’ situation “may fall under ‘close friendship’ if there is an ongoing, co-parenting type relationship, but that is subject to interpretation.”
The extent of Musk’s involvement in the life of his children with Zilis could not be learned by Reuters. The court filing published by Insider shows that in April, they asked for the children to take Musk’s last name. Musk and Zilis also listed the same address in Texas.
Joan Heminway, a business professor at the University of Tennessee’s law school, said one cannot easily prove that Musk and Zilis are close personally, even if they had IVF together. “That’s the new wrench here,” she said.

In July, Panasonic selected Kansas as the site for a new battery plant that state officials said would create up to 4,000 jobs with investment of up to $4 billion. read more
At that time, the Oklahoma Department of Commerce said it and its partners ""continue(d) to work with Project Ocean,"" Panasonic's battery factory project, and were ""optimistic for additional opportunities with them in the future"".
The department said on Friday that ""due to non-discourse agreements (on projects), we will not be providing comments on this story"".
Earlier this year, Oklahoma said it would allocate $698 million to pursue Project Ocean under a bill aimed at attracting an unidentified company that will invest a minimum of $3.6 billion and create at least 4,000 new jobs within five years.
Oklahoma is a neighbouring state to Texas, home to Tesla's car and battery production facilities.
The Japanese conglomerate also said it was looking at potential factory sites in Kansas and Oklahoma to supply the batteries to Tesla's plant in Texas. read more
Panasonic has partnered with Tesla for more than a decade, supplying batteries from its factory in Nevada, California.
The auto industry has been ramping up production of EVs to meet a surge in demand, driving up orders for batteries and raw materials such as lithium and cobalt, among others.

NASA and Russian space agency Roscosmos signed an agreement in July allowing Russian cosmonauts to fly on U.S.-made spacecraft in exchange for American astronauts being able to ride on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. read more
Russia's RIA news agency reported at the time that the agreement envisaged six flights in total between 2022 and 2024, with each country getting three flights each on the other's spacecraft.

""The agreement has now been signed for the first three flights,"" said Sergei Krikalev, executive director of Roscosmos
""If the implementation of this agreement will be positive then we will certainly continue it.""
The deal is an unusual example of Moscow and Washington still cooperating at a time when ties are at a post-Cold War low due to tensions over what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, a conflict the West calls an unprovoked war of aggression.
Russia has cast doubt over space cooperation in other areas and spoken of pulling out of the International Space Station after 2024 to develop its own orbital station. It has so far sent mixed messages however, suggesting that date could significantly slip.
The flight sharing agreement signed in July will see Russian cosmonaut Anna Kikina fly on a Crew Dragon spacecraft developed by U.S. aerospace manufacturer SpaceX in the autumn.
Kikina, who will be the first cosmonaut to fly on a Crew Dragon ship, told reporters on Friday she was initially shocked to learn she would not fly on Soyuz, Russia's flagship spacecraft that has been used since the 1960s.
""Well considering the fact that all my professional life I was preparing to fly on Soyuz, I was preparing for it, in principle, and was focusing on it... suddenly the thought settled in my head that - no - I'm not flying a Soyuz, how can that be?"" Kikina said.
""But then I had a rethink. Yes I realised that I might be going on another ship, but with the knowledge that I would definitely go on Soyuz too.""
She said she would be observing the U.S. tradition of driving to the launch pad in a Tesla (TSLA.O) produced by the carmaker headed by billionaire Elon Musk, who also founded SpaceX.
""Of course I will observe crew traditions, because I am part of this crew,"" she said.
Space exploration was one of the few areas where the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated during the Cold War, culminating in a symbolic ""space handshake"" between a cosmonaut and an astronaut during the Apollo–Soyuz mission in 1975.

California Governor Gavin Newsom first announced the plan to phase out vehicles that run only on gasoline by 2035 in September 2020. The California Air Resources Board voted on Thursday to approve the new rules, which set yearly rising zero- emission vehicle rules starting in 2026, but the Biden administration must still approve the new requirements before the plan can take effect.
California has moved faster than the federal government and other states in setting strict standards for vehicle emissions. More than a dozen other states have adopted California's earlier zero-emission requirements.

Register
""This is a historic moment for California, for our partner states and for the world as we set forth a path toward a zero emission future,"" said CARB Chair Liane Randolph.
California officials said the rules by 2037 will cut by 25% smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles. The rules mandate that 35% of the new cars sold be plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), EVs or hydrogen fuel cell by 2026. That proportion will rise to 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.
By 2030, there will be 2.9 million fewer new gas-powered vehicles sold, widening to 9.5 million fewer conventional vehicles by 2035, CARB said.
Steve Douglas, a vice president at the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and other automakers, said on Thursday the CARB rules ""are the most sweeping and transformative regulations in the history of the automobile.""
Electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) called for a faster route to all-electric sales, but the auto group said the regulations will be ""extremely challenging even in California and particularly in the early years.""
California is ahead of federal vehicle emissions rules, which currently extend only to 2026 and do not set yearly requirements for zero-emission models.

CARB's new regulation would allow automakers to sell up to 20% PHEVs by 2035. That may boost Toyota, which is investing heavily in plug-ins, and which agreed earlier this week to recognize California's authority to set vehicle rules.
Tesla, which produces only electric vehicles, said in a July 26 filing to CARB that the board should require 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and increase the stringency of the standard by ""reducing the use of polluting PHEVs in annual compliance."" It also sought changes on battery and charging cord requirements.
Tesla Senior Counsel Joseph Mendelson said on Thursday the CARB proposal ""is both achievable and paves the way for California to lead in electrifying the light duty sector.""
CARB's proposal sets tough new requirements for plug-in hybrids, which currently must have at least 10 miles (16.1 km)all-electric range and will eventually need a minimum 50-mile all-electric range label to qualify.
CARB projects that 183,000 out of about 2 million vehicles sold in California in 2035 will be plug-in hybrid.
The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association on Thursday urged President Joe Biden and the Environmental Protection Agency to ""reject California’s request for a Clean Air Act waiver to proceed with this unlawful ban.""
The group said federal approval ""would hand over sweeping federal government authority to California regulators, effectively appointing Governor Newsom and CARB as car and truck czars for the entire United States.""
The White House and EPA did not immediately comment. Biden has previously declined to back setting a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. The EPA is currently working on the next round of U.S. emissions limits through at least 2030.
Seventeen U.S. states have agreed to adopt California's tailpipe emissions rules and 15 have backed its zero-emission vehicle requirements. A group of 17 other states has challenged the EPA's decision to restore California's authority to set emissions rules that was withdrawn under former president Donald Trump.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Thursday, lifted by gains in Nvidia and other technology-related stocks as investors focused on the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference for clues about the central bank's policy outlook.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a speech on Friday that investors will dissect for indications of how aggressively the Fed may move to raise interest rates as it battles decades-high inflation.
""We're in a period of time between the end of the second-quarter earnings season and meaningful additional data from the Federal Reserve. Markets are churning a bit with a reasonably low level of volatility,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

The yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury note faded after recently hitting a two-month high. Declining interest rates tend to benefit technology stocks trading at high valuations.
""Lower interest rates have certainly put some support underneath some of the more growth-oriented sectors,"" Northey said.
Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumped 4% after the graphics chipmaker gave a weaker-than-expected quarterly forecast that many investors viewed as signaling the worst of a sales downturn may be over. That drove a rally in the Philadelphia semiconductor index (.SOX). read more

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery said many of Musk's data demands were ""absurdly broad,"" amounting to trillions of data points that ""no one in their right mind has ever tried to undertake such an effort.""
The judge said Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), has had data and documents needed to pursue his case, much of which was provided before he said on July 8 he was terminating the deal in part because Twitter was withholding information.

""My overall impression is that plaintiff has agreed to produce a tremendous amount of information to defendants, and that the information plaintiff has agreed to produce is sufficiently broad to satisfy most of plaintiff's obligations,"" wrote Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery.
Twitter was ordered to turn over data from 9,000 accounts sampled in a fourth-quarter audit to estimate the number of spam or bot users on the social media platform.
Twitter had said that data no longer existed and it would be burdensome to recreate it, although McCormick gave the company two weeks to produce it.
""We look forward to reviewing the data Twitter has been hiding for many months,"" said Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, in an emailed statement.
Twitter declined to comment.
Musk, the world's richest person, has said he wants to test that audit's accuracy because he believes the company fraudulently misrepresented that only 5% of its accounts were spam. He wants McCormick to rule he can walk away from the deal.
Twitter wants McCormick to order Musk to close the deal at the agreed price of $54.20 per share. The shares briefly rose about 1% after the ruling and ended up 0.6% at $41.05.
A five-day trial has been scheduled for Oct. 17.
Twitter said at a Wednesday court hearing that Musk's focus on spam was ""legally irrelevant"" because the company has described the spam count in regulatory filings as an estimate, not a representation. It also said the real level of spam could be higher.

The stock opened at $302 and closed at $296.07 as the split allowed investors to get two additional shares for each they owned as of Aug. 17. It had closed at $891.29 before the split on Wednesday.
This is the second stock split by Tesla in as many years and follows similar moves by high-growth companies such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) to address the growing need to diversify investor base.

Stock splits ""certainly have a higher appeal to retail investors and makes their options more affordable as well,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley.
""Retail investors are a very important cohort for Tesla and today's stock split is an acknowledgment of that fact.""
Austin-based Tesla debuted in 2010 at $17 and in a decade surged to a peak price of $2,000, becoming one of the highest priced shares on Wall Street and making it difficult for small investors to bet on the high-growth stock.
The company decided to split its stock on a five-for-one basis in August 2020 and breached $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2021.
The EV maker is the sixth company in the S&P 500 index to split its shares this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P and Dow Jones indices.
Tesla's ticker was trending on social media stocktwits.com, indicating increased chatter among individual investors. The shares have lost about 11% of their value since March when the company announced plans to increase its number of shares.
""In typical buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news style, investors tend to drastically scale back purchases of splitting stocks in the weeks ensuing the effective split date, causing price momentum to slow,"" analysts at Vanda Research said in a note.
Tesla shares have risen to take the company's market cap to over $1 trillion since its previous split
A stock split does not affect the fundamentals of a company, but makes it easier for individual investors to do small trades. The benefits of such splits, however, are becoming less clear as brokerages let customers buy parts of a company's share.
Tesla's shares have fallen about 16% so far this year amid a selloff in high-growth stocks due to worries over aggressive interest rate hikes and geopolitical uncertainties.

The group, the Dawn Project, has launched a nationwide TV campaign warning of alleged potential dangers of what Tesla calls ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) software, adding to public and regulatory scrutiny of the technology.
One of the videos posted by the group shows a Tesla vehicle with FSD software running over child-sized mannequins, and says ""Tell Congress to Shut it Down.""

In a Cease and Desist letter dated Aug. 11, Tesla said the Dawn Project and its founder ""have been disparaging Tesla's commercial interests and disseminating defamatory information to the public."" The letter was disclosed by the Dawn Project on Thursday.
Tesla threatened to take legal action, saying the tests in the videos are ""likely fraudulent"" and ""misrepresent the capabilities of Tesla’s technology.""
The U.S. safety regulator has stepped up investigations of Tesla's Autopilot system following a series of crashes.
The company said its ""FSD Beta,"" a test version of its new automated driving technology used by a limited number of consumers, ""does recognize pedestrians, including children, and when utilized properly, the system reacts to prevent or mitigate a collision.""
The Dawn Project was founded by Dan O'Dowd, a critic of Tesla's FSD system and a software entrepreneur in California who had run for the U.S. Senate.
The Dawn Project said its tests are ""are completely legitimate and not deceptive,"" and called Tesla's letter ""marketing propaganda.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
