Fisker to launch brand with imported Ocean electric SUV
Scouting for showroom space, in talks with auto part makers
Considers local production, but not before 2026
Electric cars make up just 1% of total auto sales in India
NEW DELHI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - U.S. startup Fisker Inc (FSR.N) will begin selling its Ocean electric sport-utility vehicle (SUV) in India next July and could begin manufacturing its cars locally within a few years, the company's chief executive officer told Reuters.
Sales of electric cars in India will gather pace by 2025-26, Henrik Fisker said in an interview in New Delhi, adding that the company wants to secure a first-mover advantage.
""Ultimately, India will go full electric. It may not go as fast as the U.S., China or Europe, but we want to be one of the first ones to come in here,"" Fisker said.

Electric cars currently make up just 1% of India's roughly 3 million annual car sales, with insufficient charging infrastructure and high battery costs partly to blame for the slow shift.
The government, which wants to increase this share to 30% by 2030, is offering companies billions of dollars in incentives to build their EVs and associated parts locally.
Fisker rival Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) put its India entry plans on hold after failing to secure a lower import tariff for its cars. Like Fisker, it first wanted to import vehicles to test the market before committing to local manufacturing.
While Fisker admitted it is ""very expensive"" to import vehicles into India, the company wants to use the Ocean to build its brand, with its premium pricing likely to limit numbers, he said.
The Ocean retails at around $37,500 in the United States but importing it to India would add logistics costs and a 100% import tax. That would put it out of reach of most buyers in a market where the bulk of cars sold are priced under $15,000.
""Ultimately, if you want to have somewhat of a larger volume in India, you almost have to start building a vehicle here or at least do some assembly,"" Fisker said.
The company's next EV - the smaller, five-seater PEAR - is being considered for production in India but not before 2026, he said.
""If we can get that vehicle just below $20,000 locally in India, that would be ideal. Then I think we'll get to a certain volume and market share,"" he said, adding that if they find the right local partner the timeline could be shorter.
To set up a plant in India would require volume of at least 30,000 to 40,000 cars a year, Fisker said.
He did not directly comment on the size of investment the company considered necessary, but said that to set up a plant with an annual production capacity of 50,000 cars would likely cost $800 million in India.
Fisker has a contract manufacturing agreement with Magna International (MG.TO) which will produce the Ocean at its Austrian unit and ship it to India. It also has an agreement with Foxconn to build the PEAR.
The company is scouting for real estate space to open a New Delhi showroom and is meeting auto component suppliers to source parts for its global production, he said.
""Already we are starting to build some relationships,"" he said.

Rental car company Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ.O) plans to order up to 175,000 General Motors Co (GM.N) electric vehicles over the next five years, its latest move toward zero-emission models.
The multi-billion dollar, multi-year deal could be the first of many GM agreements to supply electric vehicles to rental car companies, said Steve Carlisle, the automaker's North American operations chief, on a conference call.

""It's an enormous first step,"" Carlisle said, adding that GM is in talks about similar deals with other rental car companies.
GM shares fell more than 5% Tuesday afternoon following rival Ford Motor Co's warning late Monday that supply chain costs were $1 billion higher than expected in the third quarter. Ford shares were down more than 11%. read more
Automakers have cut reliance on low-profit, bulk sales to rental car agencies as supply chain problems curtailed production. Carlisle said GM expects to deliver electric vehicles to Hertz at close to retail profit margins.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a statement ""each rental experience will further increase purchase consideration for our products and drive growth for our company.""
GM aims to have capacity to build 1 million EVs annually in North America by 2025. Carlisle said the sales to Hertz fits within that previously announced goal.
Such deals would ease pressure on GM to hit EV sales targets through individual customer sales, a market dominated by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).
Hertz's current goal is for one-quarter of its fleet to be electric by the end of 2024. In April, Hertz said it would buy up to 65,000 electric vehicles over five years from EV maker Polestar, a joint venture between China's Geely and its Swedish Volvo unit. In October 2021, Hertz announced plans to purchase 100,000 Tesla electric cars, primarily the Model 3.
The GM deal ""spans a wide range of vehicle categories and price points â€” from compact and midsize SUVs to pickups, luxury vehicles,"" the companies said.
The first GM electric vehicles to ship to Hertz will be Chevrolet Bolt models starting early next year, Carlisle said.
GM expects Hertz to deploy many of its EVs in Los Angeles and San Francisco, helping to meet California electric vehicle quotas. Hertz Senior Vice President Jeff Nieman said the company plans to offer EVs across its network, with priority to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Orlando.
Hertz estimated customers could travel more than 8 billion miles in these EVs and save about 1.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions versus gasoline-powered vehicles.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Thursday countersued the California agency that has accused the electric carmaker of tolerating widespread race discrimination at its flagship assembly plant.
Tesla in a complaint filed in state court in Alameda County said the California Civil Rights Department (CRD), which sued the company in February, adopted ""underground regulations"" allowing it to file the lawsuit without first notifying Tesla of the claims or giving the company a chance to settle.
Tesla's counter-lawsuit alleges that the CRD violated state law by not seeking public comment before adopting procedures for investigating and suing employers.

And those procedures flout requirements that the CRD disclose details of its investigations to employers and make attempts to settle claims outside of court before suing, Tesla claims.
Tesla is seeking an order barring the CRD from following its allegedly unlawful procedures in the investigation of any employer and requiring the agency to adopt new regulations through a formal rulemaking process.
A spokesperson for the CRD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tesla had made similar claims in a bid to dismiss the California agency's lawsuit, which was denied by a state judge last month.
But the complaint filed on Thursday may allow the company's lawyers to uncover new details about the CRD's practices and its investigation of Tesla through the discovery process, which could bolster its efforts to have the case dismissed.
The CRD claims Tesla's flagship Fremont, California, plant is a racially segregated workplace where Black employees faced racist slurs and graffiti and were discriminated against in terms of job assignments, discipline and pay.
Tesla has denied wrongdoing and said the lawsuit was politically motivated.
The company in June had asked a separate California agency, the Office of Administrative Law, to investigate the CRD's alleged adoption of unlawful policies. The OAL last month declined to review Tesla's petition without explaining its decision.
Austin, Texas-based Tesla is also facing a series of race and sex discrimination cases by workers, most involving the Fremont plant.
A state judge in April cut a jury verdict for a Black worker who alleged racial harassment from $137 million to $15 million. The plaintiff rejected the reduced award and opted for a new trial, which is scheduled for March 2023.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Major Wall Street indexes ended lower on Thursday, falling for a third straight session as investors reacted to the Federal Reserve's latest aggressive move to rein in inflation by selling growth stocks, including technology companies.
The Fed lifted rates by an expected 75 basis points on Wednesday and signaled a longer trajectory for policy rates than markets had priced in, fuelling fears of further volatility in stock and bond trading in a year that has already seen bear markets in both asset classes. read more
The U.S. central bank's projections for economic growth released on Wednesday were also eye-catching, with growth of just 0.2% this year, rising to 1.2% for 2023.

Jitters were already present in the market after a number of companies - most recently FedEx Corp and Ford Motor Co (F.N) - issued dire outlooks for earnings.
As of Friday, the S&P 500's estimated earnings growth for the third quarter is at 5%, according to Refinitiv data. Excluding the energy sector, the growth rate is at -1.7%.
The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio, a common metric for valuing stocks, is at 16.8 times earnings - far below the nearly 22 times forward P/E that stocks commanded at the start of the year.
Forward PE for the index has come down but is still above the long-term average
Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, led by declines of 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively, in consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and financial (.SPSY) stocks.
Shares of megacap technology and growth companies such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) fell between 1% and 5.3% as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields hit an 11-year high.

Rising yields weigh particularly on valuations of companies in the technology sector, which have high expected future earnings and form a significant part of the market-cap weighted indexes such as the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 tech sector (.SPLRCT) has slumped 28% so far this year, compared with a 21.2% decline in the benchmark index.
""If we continue to have sticky inflation, and if (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell sticks to his guns as he indicates, I think we enter recession and we see significant drawdown on earnings expectations,"" said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets at Boston Partners.
""If this happens, I have high conviction under those conditions that we break 3,636,"" he added, referring to the S&P 500's mid-June low, its weakest point of the year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 107.1 points, or 0.35%, to 30,076.68, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 31.94 points, or 0.84%, to 3,757.99 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 153.39 points, or 1.37%, to 11,066.81.
Major U.S. airlines - which have enjoyed a rebound amid increased travel as pandemic restrictions end - were also down, with United Airlines (UAL.O) and American Airlines (AAL.O) falling 4.6% and 3.9% respectively. This took losses in the last three days to 11% for United and 10.6% for American.
JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), off 7.1% and also recording a third straight loss, closed at its lowest level since March 2020.
Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N) slid 4.4% after the Olive Garden parent reported downbeat first-quarter sales.

The electric vehicle manufacturer told the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration (NHTSA) that it would perform an over-the-air software update of the automatic window reversal system. The recall covers some 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles.
Tesla said that it was not aware of any warranty claims, field reports, crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the recall.

NHTSA said a closing window without the proper automatic reversing system may exert excessive force by pinching a driver or passenger before retracting, increasing the risk of injury.
NHTSA said the vehicles failed to comply with the requirements of a federal motor vehicle safety standard on power windows.
Tesla said that during product testing in August employees identified window automatic reversal system performance that had ""greater than expected variations in response to pinch detection.""

After extensive additional testing, Tesla determined that the vehicles' pinch detection and retraction performance in the test results did not meet automatic reversal systems requirements.
Tesla said that starting Sept. 13, vehicles in production and in pre-delivery received a software update that sets power-operated window operation to the requirements.
The software update ""enhances the calibration of the vehicleâ€™s automatic window reversal system behavior,"" Tesla said.
Tesla shares were down 3.5% in Thursday afternoon trading.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on Twitter Thursday criticized the description of the callback as a recall.
""The terminology is outdated & inaccurate. This is a tiny over-the-air software update. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no injuries,"" he said.
Both NHTSA and Tesla in documents made public on Thursday referred to the campaign as a recall.

Luca de Meo said the research and development costs were too high to go it alone and drew parallels with Apple's business model, which he described as relying on a variety of partnerships when it first ventured into smartphones.
""Our old recipes are not enough anymore. The huge investments they (the shifts to electrification) require are not sustainable,"" de Meo told the Auto Motor and Sport congress in Stuttgart, Germany.

Renault is pushing ahead with plans to split its electric vehicle (EV) and combustion engine businesses as it seeks to catch up with rivals such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in the race to cleaner driving.
It expects to unveil a detailed blueprint for the new EV entity at a capital markets day this autumn.
Three years ago, Renault controlled just 10% of the EV value chain. That figure now stood at 30% and would hit 80% well before the end of the decade, de Meo said.
Renault was forging partnerships ""all along the EV value chain"", he continued.
Alliance partners Nissan (7201.T) and Mitsubishi (7211.T) have not yet said whether they will take part in Renault's future EV unit.
Nissan chief executive Makoto Uchida told the Nikkei newspaper this week that discussions continued on the Japanese group's participation, whether through an investment or another form.

In August, CARB said it would require all new vehicles sold in California by 2035 to be electric or plug-in hybrid electrics (PHEVs) after Governor Gavin Newsom issued a 2020 executive order directing the move. CARB said the rules will reduce smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles by 25% by 2037 and result in 9.5 million fewer conventional vehicles sold by 2035. Automakers in 2035 can sell no more than 20% of models as PHEVs.
California was not as aggressive as some environmental groups wanted, or Tesla (TSLA.O), which urged ending new gas-powered vehicles by 2030.
""Of course an EV-only automaker is going to want as high a standard as possible because that is going to create a market for their credits,"" Randolph said.
California needs a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to adopt the 2035 rules, which will open the request for public comment. ""Obviously it's their decision to make but I mean that's why the waiver exists. So California can move forward and protect its residents,"" she said.
President Joe Biden has called for 50% of all new vehicle sales by 2030 to be EVs or plug-in hybrids but not endorsed a phase-out date.
Some states that previously adopted California's zero emission vehicle rules have not yet signed on for the tougher 2035 phase-out date. A spokesman for Colorado's environmental agency told Reuters, ""Colorado is certainly not California and Colorado has our own plan.""
Randolph said ""some states are ready right now"" to adopt 2035 while others will ""get more comfortable as the models continue to roll out.""
She said the regulator has other transportation emissions reductions in the works on medium- and heavy-duty trucks and for in-state locomotives. Randolph added the state is ""working really hard on looking at the Imperial Valley as a potential source of lithium"" for EVs.

The gains in the consumer discretionary sector may prove fleeting. Shares of Ford (F.N) fell nearly 12% on Tuesday after the automaker flagged a bigger-than-expected $1 billion hit from inflation, echoing warnings from sector constituents like Walmart and Target earlier in the year. The sector has fallen some 10% from its recent mid-August highs. read more
Still, some investors believe inflation and growth woes may already be largely reflected in many consumer discretionary shares. At the same time, they are betting these stocks can continue to benefit as consumers make purchases ranging from cruise tickets to new cars that they delayed early in the pandemic, said Randy Frederick, managing direction for trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.
Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital, has been adding to positions in consumer discretionary stocks including retailer Academy Sports and Outdoors Inc (ASO.O), which is up 32.6% for the quarter, and Shoe Carnival Inc (SCVL.O), which is up 0.4% for the quarter.
""It's not even a question as to whether there's going to be a recession, but how severe it will be and for how long it will last,"" he said. ""But we're seeing a lot of consumer stocks that we think will hold up and come out of this in a better position.""
Consumer stocks are rallying despite looming Fed hikes.
Bets that consumer spending on non-essential items such as vacations, coffee and automobiles will stay comparatively strong even if the Fed's battle against inflation hurts growth have helped drive the sector's gains in recent months.
Amazon.com and Tesla, which together make up about 50% of the sector's weighting, are up 15% and 37.5% respectively for the quarter, fueling much of its performance. Many smaller constituents have also outperformed, including shares of General Motors Co and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), which are up nearly 30% over the same time.
There are signs consumers remain optimistic. Wages rose 5.2% over the year that ended in August, while consumer confidence rose more than expected the same month and U.S. retail sales rebounded. read more
The Fed's rate hikes, meanwhile, will only slightly increase the unemployment rate to 4.1% by the end of 2023 from its current 3.7%, Goldman Sachs estimates.
At the same time, U.S. gasoline prices are expected to continue falling through the end of the year as refiners overproduce fuel to rebuild low inventories. That should continue bolstering discretionary stocks, since consumers spend roughly 80% of their savings at the pump on restaurants, entertainment or at department stores, according to estimates by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. read more
""Continued Fed rate hikes imply that the broad economy remains on a growth track, which typically is associated with strong consumer consumption trends,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Consumers do not appear to be overextended.""
Inflation and supply chain woes, however, are never far from investors' minds. Global fund managers have remained bearish on consumer discretionary stocks despite recent gains, with nearly 25% of those surveyed by BofA Global Research this month underweight the sector - the most of any group.
Shares will likely remain volatile until there is more evidence that the Fed has inflation under control, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
""Selling in this group will likely continue until investors again believe that future inflation measures will begin to ease,"" Stovall said.

The shelter-in-place advisory and all road closures have also been lifted, the county sheriff's office and the North County Fire Department said.
The incident, which caused a part of the Highway 1 in California to shut down, came about a year after another fire broke out in a Tesla's ""Megapack"" battery unit in Australia during testing of one of the world's biggest energy storage projects. read more

The California facility is one of the biggest utility-owned, lithium-ion battery energy storage systems in the world, and power producer PG&E said the incident has caused no electrical outage for customers.
The electric utilities company said upon detecting the issue the safety systems automatically disconnected the battery storage facility from the electrical grid and that no onsite personnel was injured due to the fire. The company said it became aware of the fire at around 01:30 a.m. on Sept. 20.
Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Tesla generates most of its revenue from its electric car business, but Chief Executive Elon Musk has pledged to grow its solar energy and battery storage business to roughly the same size as its car business for the long-term.
The company last year broke ground on its factory in Lathrop, California, to produce its large-scale, utility storage battery unit Megapack.
PG&E in April announced the commissioning of its 182.5-megawatt (MW) Tesla Megapack battery energy storage system (BESS) â€“ known as the Elkhorn Battery â€“ located at its Moss Landing electric substation in Monterey County.
PG&E said batteries are charged when energy demand is low or when solar production is high and then provide additional capacity by sending that reserved power to the grid as demand grows.
It was not immediately known who is the battery cell supplier for Tesla's battery products.

My, how times have changed.
Musk's Texas company now is floating ambitious plans to deploy thousands of humanoid robots, known as Tesla Bot or Optimus, within its factories, expanding eventually to millions around the world, according to job postings. Buzz is building within the company as Tesla is having more internal meetings on robots, a person familiar with the matter said.

Longer term, Musk said at a TED Talk robots could be used in homes, making dinner, mowing the lawn and caring for the elderly people, and even becoming a ""buddy"" or a ""catgirl"" sex partner.
The robot business eventually may be worth more than Tesla's car revenue, according to Musk, who is now touting a vision for the company that goes well beyond making self-driving electric vehicles.
At its ""AI Day"" on Sept. 30, Tesla will unveil a prototype from its project Optimus, an allusion to the powerful and benevolent leader of the Autobots in the Transformers series. Production could start next year, Musk said.
Tesla faces skepticism that it can show technological advances that would justify the expense of ""general purpose"" robots in factories, homes and elsewhere, according to robotics experts, investors and analysts interviewed by Reuters.
Tesla already employs hundreds of robots designed for specific jobs for production of its cars.
Humanoid robots have been in development for decades by Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS)'s Boston Dynamics unit. Like self-driving cars, the robots have trouble with unpredictable situations. read more
""Self-driving cars weren't really proved to be as easy as anyone thought. And it's the same way with humanoid robots to some extent,"" the lead of NASA's Dexterous Robotics Team, Shaun Azimi, told Reuters.
""If something unexpected happens, being flexible and robust to those kinds of changes is very difficult.""
At an ""Autonomy"" event in 2019, Musk promised 1 million robotaxis by 2020 but has yet to deliver such a car.
Musk's robots may be able to demonstrate basic capabilities at the event, but it would be hard for them to impress public expectations of robots that are as capable as humans, experts say.
To succeed, Tesla will need to show robots doing multiple, unscripted actions, said Nancy Cooke, a professor in human systems engineering at Arizona State University. Such proof could provide a boost to Tesla stock, which is down 25% from its 2021 peak.
""If he just gets the robot to walk around, or he gets the robots to dance, that's already been done. That's not that impressive,"" she said.
Tesla did not respond to Reuters' request for comments, but Musk in the past proved skeptics wrong, jump-starting the electric car market and building a rocket company, SpaceX, although some product launches were behind schedule.
IN-HOUSE EXPERTISE

Initially, Optimus will perform boring or dangerous jobs, including moving parts around its factories, according to Musk.
Musk acknowledged that humanoid robots do not have enough intelligence to navigate the real world without being explicitly instructed.
But he said Tesla can leverage its expertise in AI and key components to develop and produce smart, yet less expensive, humanoid robots at scale.
He tweeted on Monday that its Autopilot team is also working on its Optimus robot, when asked about fixes of what it calls Full Self-Driving beta - a test version of its new automated driving software.

Tesla is on hiring spree for people to work on humanoid bi-pedal robots, with about 20 job postings on ""Tesla Bot"" including jobs for designing key robot parts like ""actuators"".
""The code you will write will at term run in millions of humanoid robots across the world, and will therefore be held to high quality standards,"" one of the job postings said.
Tesla has over 2 million vehicles on the road.
Jonathan Hurst, chief technology officer at Agility Robotics, a humanoid robot firm founded in 2015 said the technology ""is right now starting to turn the corner.""
""Certainly, an important measure of success is do they make money from it,"" he told Reuters, referring to Tesla's humanoid robot efforts.
HUMAN HELP?
Analysts see more pageant than product. ""It's all part of distracting people and giving them the next shiny object to chase after,"" Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid said.
""Investors are not excited about Optimus,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, which holds Tesla stocks. ""It's just such a low probability that it works at scale,"" he said, saying it is ""infinitely harder than self-driving cars.""
And then there is Musk's own experience with robots in the factory.
During the 2018 production hell, Musk specifically noted the problems of the ""fluff bot,"" an assembly robot that failed to perform simple tasks that human hands can do - picking up pieces of ""fluff"" and placing them on batteries.
He said the cost of having technicians maintain the complicated robot far exceeded that of hiring someone to do the assembly.
The fluff bot is ""a funny example but drives home the point that autonomy often doesn't generalize well, and so handling soft fluffy material that isn't as predictable as a rigid part was causing a huge problem,"" Aaron Johnson, a mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said.
""Human hands are way better at doing that,"" Musk said.

Sept 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes ended a seesaw session higher on Monday, as investors turned their attention to this week's policy meeting at the Federal Reserve and how aggressively it will hike interest rates.
Even more so than the Ukraine war or corporate earnings, the actions of the U.S. central bank are driving market sentiment as traders try to position themselves for a rising interest rate environment.
The S&P 500 (.SPX) and the Nasdaq (.IXIC) rebounded from logging their worst weekly percentage drop since June on Friday, as markets fully priced in at least a 75 basis point rise in rates at the end of Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting, with Fed funds futures showing a 15% chance of a whopping 100 bps increase.

Separation pacts could be misleading, judge says
Workers say Tesla flouted law requiring 60 days' notice of layoffs
Judge won't nix agreements signed since lawsuit was filed
Sept 19 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc must notify factory workers who were laid off in the last three months of a proposed class action accusing the electric carmaker of failing to give adequate notice before engaging in mass layoffs, a federal magistrate judge has ruled.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan Hightower in Austin, Texas said on Friday that separation agreements Tesla asked workers who were terminated to sign may have been misleading and caused them to waive their rights under the federal law requiring employers with 100 or more employees to give 60 days' notice of layoffs.
Hightower, however, denied a request by the plaintiffs who sued Tesla in June to bar the company from communicating with potential class members and to strike down separation agreements Tesla has procured since the lawsuit was filed, saying it was too broad.

A representative of Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shannon Liss-Riordan, who represents the plaintiffs, said on Monday that Tesla has been trying to get workers to sign away their right under federal law to 60 days of pay while offering them only a week or two of pay.
Liss-Riordan in an email said Tesla chief executive Elon Musk ""called this case 'trivial,' but the federal court has made clear that Tesla's actions in ignoring the law are anything but trivial.""
The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires businesses to notify workers of mass layoffs at least 60 days in advance unless they are caused by natural disasters or ""unforeseeable business circumstances.""
The lawsuit by two former Tesla employees accuses the company of violating the WARN Act by abruptly laying off more than 500 workers at its Sparks, Nevada gigafactory as part of a nationwide purge of its workforce.
Tesla has laid off hundreds of employees since June, when Musk in an email told company executives to freeze hiring and cut about 10% of salaried staff. Musk later clarified that he expected Tesla's total workforce to grow in the coming year.
Tesla has moved to dismiss the case, claiming it was merely ""right-sizing"" by firing poorly performing workers and not engaging in layoffs that require advance notice. The company also says workers who lost their jobs signed agreements to bring legal disputes in arbitration rather than court.
The plaintiffs are seeking class action status for all former Tesla employees throughout the United States who were laid off in May or June without advance notice.
The case is Lynch v. Tesla Inc, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, No. 1:22-cv-00597.

The central premise of autonomous vehicles - that computers and artificial intelligence will dramatically reduce accidents caused by human error - has driven much of the research and investment.
But there is a catch: Making robot cars that can drive more safely than people is immensely tough because self-driving software systems simply lack humans' ability to predict and assess risk quickly, especially when encountering unexpected incidents or ""edge cases.""

""Well, my question would be, 'Why?'"" said Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise, a unit of General Motors (GM.N), when asked if he could see a point where remote human overseers should be removed from operations.
""I can provide my customers peace of mind knowing there is always a human there to help if needed,"" Vogt said. ""I don't know why I'd ever want to get rid of that.""
This is the first time Cruise has acknowledged the long-term need for remote human operators.
Like air traffic controllers, such human supervisors could be sitting tens of hundreds of miles away monitoring video feeds from multiple AVs, sometimes with a steering wheel, ready to step in and get stuck robot drivers moving again - AVs invariably stop when they cannot figure out what to do.
Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Waymo and Argo, which is backed by Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), declined to comment when asked the same question.
GM recalled and updated software in 80 Cruise self-driving vehicles this month after a June crash in San Francisco left two people injured. U.S. safety regulators said the recalled software could ""incorrectly predict"" an oncoming vehicle's path, and Cruise said the unusual scenario would not recur after the update. read more
For some, the idea that human supervisors could be here to stay raises more doubts about the technology.
Truly autonomous vehicles are far behind the optimistic rollout schedules predicted just a few years ago.
In 2018, GM sought U.S. government approval for a fully autonomous car without a steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals that would enter its commercial ride-sharing fleet in 2019. That vehicle, the Cruise Origin, now is not slated to begin production until spring 2023, Vogt said.
In 2019, Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk promised a million robotaxis ""next year for sure"" - though his company's ""Full Self Driving"" offering has been criticized because its cars are not capable of driving themselves without a human behind the wheel and ready to take manual control in an emergency.
In a June interview on YouTube, Musk said developing self-driving cars was ""way harder than I originally thought, by far."" But when asked for a timeline, he said Tesla could make it ""this year.""
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
The undelivered promise of true autonomy has raised the stakes for the AV industry.
""If these companies don't succeed over the next two years, they're not going to exist anymore,"" said Mike Wagner, CEO of Edge Case Research, which helps AV companies assess, manage and insure risk. ""It's a case of put up or shut up at this point.""
REMOTE HUMANS WATCHING
Many AV startups today use humans as remote supervisors, alongside safety drivers sitting behind the wheel. read more
Those remote humans are an additional expense, but help self-driving cars handle edge cases. These could include something as basic as an unfamiliar set of lane closures during road construction, or erratic, unpredictable behavior by pedestrians or human drivers.
When a robot driver encounters an edge case, ""it puts its hands up and says, 'I don't know what's going on,'"" said Koosha Kaveh, CEO of Imperium Drive, which is using humans as remote operators for cars in the English city of Milton Keynes. Over time, those people will act as ""air traffic controllers,"" supervising a growing number of autonomous cars.
Cruise's Vogt says the company's AVs on the roads in San Francisco currently rely on humans less than 1% of the time. But across hundreds, thousands or even millions of AVs, that would add up to a significant amount of time stopped on the road waiting for human guidance.

Imperium Drive's Kaveh said as more self-driving cars - which are more predictable than humans - hit the roads the number of edge cases will drop, ""but you will never get to zero edge cases.""
""Even decades from now you will not get to 100% truly autonomous vehicles,"" Kaveh added.
Nevertheless, competition is rising. Some Chinese cities are pushing to allow active AV testing more quickly.
The need to tackle edge cases and cut the costs of everything from sensors to the number of humans in the loop in order to get to market has also intensified because investor funding for autonomous cars has plummeted.
Doubt has crept in as investors puzzle over how soon autonomous business will turn profitable. Simpler or slower AVs like trucks or last-mile delivery services operating on highways or on set, low-speed routes are likely to reach profitability first, but will still take years to get there.
Overall investment in future mobility startups has slowed, with AV-focused companies hit especially hard, representing less than 10% of venture investment in the second quarter, according to investor website PitchBook. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3Rzy04y)

Investment in AV startups in the quarter dropped to $958 million. Just two years ago AV investment was booming, as Alphabet's Waymo raised $3 billion, Didi's AV unit raised $500 million and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) acquired AV startup Zoox for $1.3 billion, according to PitchBook.
'RUSH TO MARKET'
Autonomous systems are not as capable as people because their ""perception and prediction algorithms are not as good as how a human brain processes and decides,"" said Chris Borroni-Bird, an independent consultant who previously led advanced-vehicle programs at GM and Waymo.
For instance, a human when seeing a ball roll into the road - harmless by itself - will assume it could be followed by a child and hit the brakes far quicker than an AV, Borroni-Bird said.
""I am concerned that AV companies will rush to market without proving the safety is better than human-driven vehicles,"" he added.
The problem is there are ""tens of billions of potential edge cases"" that AVs could encounter, said James Routh, CEO of AB Dynamics (ABDP.L), which conducts tests and runs simulations on cars including on the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) that are the foundation of autonomous driving features.
Auto data startup Wejo Group Ltd (WEJO.O) receives 18 billion data points daily from millions of connected cars and is helping with simulations for AVs, said Sarah Larner, executive vice president for strategy and innovation.
""But there are so many variables such as weather, you can take an edge case and then have to layer in all the different variants,"" she said. ""It's truly millions of outputs.""
DRIVERLESS DELIVERY
In its track tests for cars, AB Dynamics employs a robot arm that it plans to retrofit on slow-moving mining and agricultural trucks to make them largely autonomous.
Routh envisages a remote team of humans supervising fleets of, for instance, self-driving mining trucks operating in closed environments.
He does not see that scenario working for vehicles in faster, more open environments because it could be difficult for remote human supervisors to react quickly enough to dangers.
Within the next 12 months, British online food delivery and technology company Ocado Group Plc (OCDO.L) will roll out a small fleet of driverless delivery vehicles with autonomous vehicle software startup Oxbotica - backed by remote human supervisors - that will operate on just a few streets on set routes in a small UK city and never drive at speeds above 30 miles (48 km) per hour.
""At 30 miles an hour, if a vehicle panics, it can hit the emergency brake and seek help,"" Ocado's head of advanced technology, Alex Harvey, said. ""This feels like a very viable strategy at low speed.""
""But you can't play that game on a motorway,"" Harvey added, because hard stops in edge cases would pose a safety risk.
Harvey said it should take around five years for Ocado to develop a profitable driverless delivery system. More than half of Ocado's UK customers could be reached with AVs driving no more than 40 mph he said. Eventually, the service could be rolled out to Ocado clients like U.S. retail chain Kroger Co.

Tesla will test the production lines for the upgrade during From Sept. 19 to Nov. 30, the statement added.
Reuters previously reported Tesla had been ramping up its output to reach a target of producing around 22,000 units of Model 3 and Model Y cars per week at the Shanghai plant.

Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The U.S. automaker planned to invest up to 1.2 billion yuan ($170 million) to expand production capacity at its Shanghai factory that would allow it to employ 4,000 more people at the site, state-backed Beijing Daily newspaper reported last November.
The project was originally expected to be finished in April, the Chinese media reported then.

""Tesla put everything reported in the American newspaper into perspective. The plant is still being built,"" Cristiani said, referring to a report in the Wall Street Journal last week that Tesla was pausing its plans to make batteries in Germany. read more
Cristiani also denied reports by local newspaper rbb last week that he had struck the topic of an extension to Tesla's land to be used for logistics purposes from the local council agenda, saying it was never on the agenda.
The carmaker had applied for the extension in May and it was being discussed by the relevant community representatives, Cristiani said. Once these discussions were complete, the topic would come onto the agenda.
Tesla was not immediately available for comment.
